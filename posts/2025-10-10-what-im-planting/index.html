<h2>What I’m Planting This Fall</h2>
<p>Autumn might not scream “planting season,” but in Central Texas, October is actually ideal for getting perennials in the ground. Cooler temperatures give roots time to establish before winter dormancy, meaning stronger, more resilient plants come spring – and a better shot at surviving our brutal summers.</p>
<p>Here are three new native species I’m welcoming to the mix this season.</p>
<h3>Dwarf Barbados Cherry</h3>
<p><i><a href="https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=magl6">Malpighia glabra ‘Nana’</a> – Shade-tolerant with summer blooms and winter interest</i></p>
<p>Our backyard is predominantly shady with several, sometimes puzzling, microclimates. A few weeks ago, I spotted this plant with charming pink flowers and dark puckered leaves at the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center’s fall plant sale. The dwarf variety grows to about 2–4 feet and handles dappled shade well. Butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds are attracted to the fragrant blooms in summer, while birds enjoy the bright red fruits that succeed. And, in a mild winter, they remain evergreen!</p>

<h3>Flame Acanthus ‘Benny’s Gold’</h3>
<p><i><a href="https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=ANQUW">Anisacanthus quadrifidus var. wrightii</a> – Tough and vibrant with pollinator appeal</i></p>
<p>No offense to the other plants, but our red flame acanthus has undoubtedly been the superstar. We purchased it from the San Antonio Botanic Garden in February 2024 and it has happily sprawled out over a toasty spot in our yard despite not-too-consistent watering and much-too-consistent trampling. I’ve dreamed of our eastern fence draped in climbing cream roses and adorned in drifts of purple, pink, and orange flowers. Needless to say, I have lofty expectations for this gold varietal, but I think it’s fit for the challenge!</p>

<h3>Mountain Sage</h3>
<p><i><a href="https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=SARE4">Salvia regla</a> – Bold color and hummingbird magnet for partial shade</i></p>
<p>Maybe this is cheating because I have three of these in containers that have been barely surviving for a year now. They’ve bloomed once or twice, and their oversized, red-orange tubular flowers are <i>stunning</i>. We have an understory spot (a desert shade sage, who knew) along our south fence that would be so dreamy blanketed in their crimson blooms. I’m betting they just need to be in the ground to really thrive.</p>

<p>It’s always a bit of a gamble, but I’m excited to see what takes root. Fall feels like a good time to try again. If you’ve had any experience with these plants, or others that have surprised you, I’d be curious to know.</p>
